"# firstgame" 
Description:

This is my first project for the CFG program. It will put my knowledge to the test while allowing me
to present that information creatively. 

The objective of my game is for the player to answer trivia questions revolving around global cultures/foods.
I am starting with 3 different questons in order to build my framework and add on to there
(A maximum of 10 questions is my goal)

Each individual question will have 3 options for the player to choose from.
If the player answers correctly, a success pop-up will notify the player.
If the player chooses incorectly, a pop will notify them.
The question will change to the next one regardless of answer. 
The correct total will be added and display on the end screen.
