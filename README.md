# Flash-Card-Game-CFG

This is my first project for the CFG program. It will put my knowledge to the test while allowing me to present that information creatively.

This game is a simple matching games, using world flags as the cards. The player will click on two flags at a time until a match is found and will continue until the timer runs out. 

Features:

Score tracker, that keeps track of cards that are matched.
Start/Stop buttons, that allow player to begin when ready and stop the timer if complete before the timer runs out. 
Restart button, refreshes the page. 
Player cannot begin flipping cards before timer is started.
Player cannnot click on more than two cards at a time to prevent cheating. 
Card locations are randomized between games.
Easily scaleable - Timer can be adjusted and number of cards can easily be changed.
