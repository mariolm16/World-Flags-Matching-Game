"# firstgame" 
**Description:**

This is my first project for the CFG program. It will put my knowledge to the test while allowing me
to present that information creatively. 

The objective of my game is for the player to answer trivia questions revolving around global cultures/foods.
I am starting with 3 different questons in order to build my framework and add on to there


Each individual question will have 3 options for the player to choose from.
If the player answers correctly, a success pop-up will notify the player and give a brief description.
If the player chooses incorectly, a pop will notify them of the correct answer.
The question will continue to the next one regardless of answer. 
The correct total will be added and display on the end screen.

**Brief Example:**

_Will_add_working_example_once_ready_

Text Example:

Q:What animal is on the Mexican flag?

A: Eagle, Turtle, Shark,

Correct: "Correct! The Mexican flag depicts an Eagle grasping a snake!"

**List of Technologies used:**

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

**Install Instructions:**

The game will be accessed through internet browser and URL


**Stretch Goals/ Additional Ideas**

The answer for each question will be on a card, with a picture for each option, as opposed to
plain text. 
Cards will flip in order to inform player of correct/incorrect choice.
Beginning with 3 questions/answers but want to complete at least 10 for presentation.
